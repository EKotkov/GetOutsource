# Case Study: Collaboration with the Production company in creating professional grades and Personal Devepment Plans for Software Development Department


### **Problem**
The organization faced challenges related to the lack of a structured approach to employee growth and skill development in the Software Development Department. This led to:Difficulty aligning the employee’s potential with organizational goals:
1. Difficulty with managing salary and promotion budgets;
2. Missed opportunities to utilize and enhance key technical and leadership competencies;
3. Risk of reduced motivation and engagement due to the absence of a clear career path.
### **Expected Outcome**
The implementation of Grades and Personal Development Plans (PDP) is aimed at addressing these challenges by:
1. Creating clear and transparent career paths for every role in the Department (from Junior to Team Lead);
2. Aligning the employee’s career growth with the strategic objectives of the organization;
3. Clearly defining short- and long-term professional goals to foster motivation and commitment;
4. Enhancing technical and leadership skills to improve overall team performance.
### **Proposed Solution**
To solve the problem, a detailed Grades and PDPs was developed, which includes:
1. A competency matrix outlining the required skills at different career levels (Junior, Middle, Senior, Tech Lead);
2. A roadmap for achieving technical and leadership milestones over the next 6–12 months;
3. A structured approach to learning based on the 70:20:10 model, combining practical assignments, feedback from mentors, and formal training;
4. Regular progress reviews to ensure alignment with organizational needs.
### **Implementation**
- Conducted an initial assessment of the employee’s current skills and competencies;
- Collaborated with the manager to define measurable short-term (6 months) and long-term (12 months) goals;
- Integrated specific actions into the PDP, such as hands-on projects, feedback sessions, 1-1 meetings, and participation in professional courses and conferences.
### **Results**
- Increased employee engagement through a clear vision of career prospects.
- Improved efficiency and technical expertise in key areas.
- Strengthened alignment between the employee’s professional growth and the organization’s strategic goals:
- Enhancing the manageability of the salary budget, implementing salary and raise planning.
### **Conclusion**
The development and implementation of the PDP resolved key challenges by providing clarity, structure, and motivation for the employee. It also created a scalable model for addressing similar needs across other roles in the organization.
